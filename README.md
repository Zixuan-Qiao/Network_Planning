# Software-Defined-Network Planning Algorithms
This repository showcases part of a group project. 

## Introduction
In this project, some state-of-art network planning algorithms are implemented to tackle the controller placement problem in SDN. The main body of the process is a genetic algorithm, which is implemented in GAPA.py. 
The nodes_extraction.py processes raw data from Survivable Network Design Library to test the algorithms. The generated data has a format that is similar to JSON, an example is shown in ta2_cities.py. 

## Flowchart of GAPA.py
