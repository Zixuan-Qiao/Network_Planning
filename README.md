# Software-Defined-Network Planning Algorithms
This repository showcases part of a group project. 

## Introduction
In this project, some state-of-art network planning algorithms are implemented to tackle the controller placement problem in SDN. 

The main body of the process is a genetic algorithm, which is implemented in GAPA.py. By default, it employs functions from KMCA_complete.py to calculated chromosome metrics. When it imports functions from metrics_only_assignment.py, it implements MOP. It imports hyperparameters from parameter_setting.py. 

KMCA_complete.py implements KMCA to find the minimal delay node assignment for a given controller placement with consideration of capacity balance. It imports hyperparameters from parameter_setting.py and delay matrices from omega_matrices.py, which is generated by omega_matrix_generation.py. 

The nodes_extraction.py and link_delay_dictionary.py processes raw data from Survivable Network Design Library to test the algorithms. The generated data has a format that is similar to JSON, an example is shown in ta2_cities.py and ta2_links.py.

Note: CPOA is not included in this repository since it was implemented by other group member.
